- **Newly Added:**
    - animations to dropdown menus
    - secondary images to footer socials
    - first figure & respective img/figure styling
    - placeholder text and information within main element
    - table (quite literally and, yes, pun intended) of contents at the bottm of "main" element
      
- **Newly Removed:**
    - Dashed borders in nav bar
    - double border surrounding header and footer
  
- **Known Issues:**
    - Odd coloring between drop-down menus and header
    - The informational table at the bottom of the "main" element is unintelligible & contains no viewable content other than placeholders
    - no animation/transition on the background "bubble-like" color that shows behind hovered anchors
    - switching of footer images is quite jarring
